  <h1>Individual Feedback</h1>

  <h2>Jaylene's Feedback</h2>

  <h3>Cosmetic Changes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Get rid of water mark on main page.

      <ul>
        <li>Still think that we will have some sort of graphic on
          the main page once we receive that from the graphic
          designer. Otherwise the application looks rather
          boring.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Changes to UI widgets and controls (buttons)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Be sure to watch button size and functional usage in
      relation to screen size of a mobile device.

      <ul>
        <li>Have decided to use the iPhone tab bar with the
          "magic" number of 5 tabs. This article details some
          design guidelines for the tab bar: <a href=
                                                "http://www.significantpixels.com/2011/04/04/the-iphone-tab-bar/">
            http://www.significantpixels.com/2011/04/04/the-iphone-tab-bar/</a>
        </li>

        <li>Have also decided to allow user to configure the tabs
          that they'd like to see on their tab bar.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Make sure that there is enough screen space to display
      the number of options that will be needed, especially with
      the long lists.

      <ul>
        <li>Have decided to use the tab bar, scrollable table
          views and wheel pickers</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Changes to Functionality</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>I would suggest integrating some of the existing tools
      already available to students. For example, the UM website
      map allows for the user to get the number of steps and the
      distance between buildings as well as allows you to redirect
      your path. This would allow for easy use for students already
      accustomed to that map.

      <ul>
        <li>Have decided to use the MapKit Framework, rather than
          UM's map.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Consider adding delete button to individual classes

      <ul>
        <li>We did this. When viewing course list, user can swipe
          backwards on the course and an option to delete the
          course will appear.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Make the next class automatically display on the opening
      map screen, so the user can tell at a glance where they are
      going

      <ul>
        <li>We will have a tab bar option for viewing the
          location of the Next Class</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The Add Class confirmation screen could have a "do not
      show this screen in the future" option

      <ul>
        <li>This was removed from the design altogether</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Will's Feedback</h2>

  <h3>Changes to UI controls</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The notification alert slider should allow for a greater
      range of time than just 5-15 minutes</li>

    <li>User should be able to edit schedule from the main
      screen</li>

    <li>User should have easy to access add button on the main
      screen</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cosmetic changes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Start screen is busy with the map there, maybe just have
      it on the map page.</li>

    <li>Really great work on startup screen and button
      layout.</li>

    <li>Place less elements on the select class.</li>

    <li>Major concern is the size of the schedule viewer in
      relation to the size of an ipod or iphone</li>

    <li>Be careful with button size in relation to screen
      proportion.</li>

    <li>Make sure that there is enough screen space to display
      the number of options that will be needed, especially with
      the long lists</li>

    <li>Make sure some of the options can be scaled down to fit
      the iPhone</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Functionality / Implementation</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>On the starting screen it would be nice to show your next
      class location on the map</li>

    <li>User should have the ability to look at only one day or
      one hour</li>

    <li>How are you filling spinners?</li>

    <li>It does do alert pop ups for class times.</li>

    <li>Display class locations on the main screen map.</li>

    <li>Make the next class automatically display on the opening
      map screen, so the user can tell at a glance where they are
      going</li>

    <li>Could consider some voice and text options to allow for
      students with disabilities to use app as well.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Suggestions that were incorporated into Project 2</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Changed initial screen to have only a map with user's
      current location</li>

    <li>Broke up select course page into two separate pages with
      less on screen UI widgets</li>

    <li>Changed layout of how course schedule is displayed into
      list format</li>

    <li>Map display on initial screen</li>

    <li>Added text direction heads up display</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Jon-Michael's Feedback</h2>

  <h3>Cosmetic changes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Don't connect the user to the destination in the map -
      use an indicator/compass so they don't have to go straight to
      the class

      <ul>
        <li>This was a great idea because it gives the user the
          flexibility to run a few errands before their class. The
          user will not feel like they are forced to go to class.
          This has been incorporated.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Have the usual "Edit" and "+" top nav in the app.

      <ul>
        <li>This will enable navigation between screens and has
          been incorporated.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Changes to functionality</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Add classes that are not in catalog

      <ul>
        <li>Most users will have classes that are in the catalog,
          and if they don't, they can lookup a building/room
          instead. However, we do not plan to incorporate custom
          class creation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Integrate with the Academic Planner

      <ul>
        <li>Unfortunately, getting access to the academic planner
          means dealing with campus IT red-tape. We are not
          incorporating this for now, but perhaps a v3.0 could
          integrate.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Show class times and locations

      <ul>
        <li>We are incorporating this into the class schedule
          screen.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Allow searching by class abbreviation (e.g., CSCI instead
      of just "Computer Science")

      <ul>
        <li>We have chosen to adopt this as the sole method of
          finding classes, so instead of searching by class name,
          one searches by class number after selecting a department
          (e.g., "ECON 511").</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Add a map tab that shows saved classes as pins.

      <ul>
        <li>We are incorporating this as the main screen of the
          app (after the brief splash screen). Users will have the
          option to view all classes at once or view one class at a
          time.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Changes to UI widgets and controls</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Remove the "Save" button from the search results/map view

      <ul>
        <li>In the consolidation process, we have front-loaded
          this step - users decide to save before they view the
          class on a map.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Remove "Undo" button after saving a class, since it isn't
      really needed and is confusing

      <ul>
        <li>We have incorporated this - users can remove a class
          by viewing their class list and then deleting.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Have two modes for searching for classes. The "slow" one
      would be a dropdown to filter by subject, by class, and by
      section. The "fast" one would be a search box to
      autocomplete.

      <ul>
        <li>We have incorporated this by showing a list of
          classes with a search/filter box at the top.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Have a way to cancel/clear out search (like the little
      "X" in Safari's location bar)

      <ul>
        <li>We have incorporated this on the search/filter text
          boxes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Changes to task flow</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Include a map on the front page, instead of defaulting to
      "find a class"

      <ul>
        <li>We have incorporated this in order to minimize the
          amount of clicks/taps required to view directions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Individual and Group Contributions to Design</h2>

  <p>Our initial designs were fairly similar in look-and-feel, as
    they all mainly conformed to Apple mobile standards. Thus, much
    of the design that we have chosen to use comes from all three
    of the group members.</p>

  <h3>Similar features:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Add a course progression</li>

    <li>Remove a course</li>

    <li>Limit the number of items on a screen at one time to
      accommodate the small screen size of a mobile device, the
      iPhone.</li>

    <li>Our Find a Building design was very similar</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Individual features:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Will: home/main screen with live map of campus</li>

    <li>Jaylene and Jon-Michael both incorporated the iPhone tab
      bar</li>

    <li>Jon-Michael had a text search feature for subjects and
      buildings that we are incorporating</li>
  </ol>
