This is the report for HCI. Editing is a little stupid, but here's the process.

  1. Make changes to scenarios in <data/sects.csv>. This is a tab-delimited
     file.
  2. Make changes to screenshots in <data/desc.csv>. Also tab-delimited.
  3. If you have Ruby installed, run `rake` to view the HTML in the `public`
     dir.
  4. Otherwise, commit and push to the repo.
